# TinyAudio

TinyAudio is a super simple C# library for realtime audio playback. It's intended to make it really easy
to write PCM/IEEE waveform data directly to the system's default audio device. Currently it is Windows-only,
supporting either WASAPI or DirectSound, but my intention is to make it cross-platform eventually.
